## Problem 1: Reviewing a number of research papers
When doing research for a select topic, we have to gather a great number of research papers and then go through them individually to compare, which is time consuming. 

### Customer Segments
- Students
- Researchers
- People in the academe

### Unique Value Proposition
A research agent that scrapes the web for available research papers and summarizing them for ease of understanding. Comparative analysis can also be done by the Agent if needed. 

## Problem 2: On boarding a new employee
Most of the time, especially in software development teams, a lot of resource is spent when on boarding a new employee. The new employee has to go through and study codebases, documentations, product requirements, tools, etc. 

### Customer Segments
- Companies that has problems maintaining a clean set of documentations ranging from startups, up to large scale companies.

### Unique Value Proposition
An AI tool for helping keeping documentations updated, and providing the new employee a summarized view of what he has to study to catch up quickly. The AI tool can be a chatbot, with RAG capabilities for internal documents and code. 

## Problem 3: Labeling of images for computer vision tasks such as image classification or object detection
Labeling images requires a lot of manual labor, specially for really large datasets. Brings up the question: Why not use VLMs directly? VLMs are really huge and costly to use. Small, efficient computer vision models are available but will need finetuning to fit a specific use case. 

### Customer Segments
- Companies with applications that require fast and efficient computer vision mdoels
- Students or researchers doing computer vision tasks

### Unique Value Proposition
An AI tool for helping automating labeling of images. The images can then be quickly reviewed by human or not at all. This will help mitigate the effort and resources required for labeling, even remove the need for a labeling team at all.
